Stretch Questions

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
You can use the flex box.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

<div>
<h1-h6>
<section>
...
<span>
<a>
...
<img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

Block elements inherit width and height from parent elements and can often create funky problems with your design.

Using the flex-box model makes the parent block a flex container and the child becomes a flex item and it removes the constraints of block or inline elements.
